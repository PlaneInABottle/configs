<required-design-patterns>
Apply these patterns to ensure maintainability and testability:

- **Dependency Injection**: ALWAYS pass dependencies via constructors/initializers. NEVER hard-code dependencies or use global state.
- **Repository Pattern**: ISOLATE all data access logic. CREATE interfaces for repositories to allow mocking in tests.
- **Strategy Pattern**: USE this pattern for interchangeable algorithms (e.g., different providers, formats). AVOID long switch/if-else chains.
- **Factory Pattern**: CENTRALIZE object creation complexity. USE factories when creation logic involves multiple steps or conditions.
- **Middleware/Wrappers**: ENCAPSULATE cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling, auth) in wrappers or middleware. DO NOT mix them with core business logic.
