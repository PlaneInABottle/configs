<mandatory-solid-adherence>
Strictly adhere to SOLID principles in every implementation:

- SRP (Single Responsibility): ENSURE every class/function has exactly one responsibility. SPLIT "god classes" immediately.
- OCP (Open/Closed): DESIGN for extension. ALLOW behavior changes via new classes/plugins, NOT by modifying existing source.
- LSP (Liskov Substitution): VERIFY that all subclasses can replace their parent without breaking functionality.
- ISP (Interface Segregation): CREATE focused, specific interfaces. AVOID forcing clients to depend on methods they don't use.
- DIP (Dependency Inversion): DEPEND on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations. INJECT dependencies.

<general-architecture-commands>
- SoC (Separation of Concerns): STRICTLY SEPARATE distinct logic types (UI, Business Logic, Data Access) into different modules/layers.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): IDENTIFY and ABSTRACT duplicates. If you see the same logic twice, create a shared utility.
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): PRIORITIZE the simplest solution that works. REJECT complexity unless absolutely required.
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): IMPLEMENT ONLY what is requested NOW. REJECT speculative features.
